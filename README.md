# OTFS_Modulation_FPGA
This code presents a computationally efficient design of an OTFS modulation system on a Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC FPGA. Resource requirements are reported to demonstrate implementation efficiency. This architecture has six parts:
*Random-Bit Generator
*QAM Modulator
*Array reshaping
*ISFFT and Heisenberg
*Wigner and SFFT
*QAM Demodulator
